NEXTJS 15


day1

- a react framework to create fullstack appps

-NextJS simplifies the process of building production-ready web apps

- uses react for building UIs but also offers more 
fearutes(routing,data fecthing,optimized rendering) out of the box without needing 
external libraries

- nextjs has rules/conventions that must be followed to use/implmenet its features

- some features nextjs gives us out of the box
1. routing(no need for 3rdparty library like axios)
2. it simplifies routing by using file-based routing
3. allows api routes
4. flexible rendering(supports both server-side and client-side rendering). when implemented
properly, it improves performance and search engine optimzation
5. strealined data-fetching(makes data fetching more straight-forward)with built-in async
support in components 
6. flexible styling approaches(css modules, tailwind, css-injected solutions) to 
match user preference
7. out-of-the-box optimization for images,fonts,scripts enhancing core app web vitals and
overall user experience
8. dev and prod build system


-npx create-next-app@latest


day2
- generated a nextjs 15 app with the npx create-next-app@latest command, went with basic 
installtion prompts
- clicked yes to typescript,ESlint, appRouter,tailwind,and to SRC directory
- rendwered my first 'hello world' in a nextjs app
- studied the folder structure(mostly similar to react)
- packkage.json holds all project dependencies, dev depepndecies and scripts
- node_modules holds all installed dependencies
- public folder holds all statuc assets like images/svgs
- .next folder is where a nextJS gets served from in dev/prod mode
- the SRC folder contains the app folder which is the app router(where the main/job is being
done)
- when we run yarn run dev, execution starts from package.json,moves into the
layout.tsx rendering the root layout component,then looks for page.tsx folder in the app
folder and renders it in the root layout
- difference between page.tsx and layout.tsx in nextjs?
- page.tsx slots into layout.tsx as one of its children


day3
- understanding React-server-component(RSC) as a prerequisite for understanding how routing
works in nextjs
 - RSC is a new architecturevintroduced by the react team and its adopted by nextjs
- RSC architecture introduces new ways of creating react components by dividing them
into 2 parts. 1.server components 2.client components
- by default, all files in nexjs are treated as server components
- server-side components performs basic server-side tasks eg reading files, fetching data
directly from a db
- trade off with server-side components is that they cant use react-hooks(useState,useEffect),
or handle user interactions(forms)
- client components are traditionl/typical reactvcomponents
- to create client components you'll need to add "use client" at the top of component file
- server-components waits for certain operation to complete before rendering content


day4
- routing in nextjs
- nextjs uses a file-system based routing system
- file-system based routing means URLs you can access in your browser are determined by how
you organize your files and folders in your code
- routing conventions/rules to remeber and adhere to
1. all routes must live inside the app folder
2. routes files must be named page.js or page.tsx depending on if you're using typescript
3. each folder represents a segmentvof the URL path
- routes are basically tid to their folder names within the app directory
- navigate into app directory, create folder, the page.tsx/page.js file inide the folder 
will automatically be treated as a route
- nextJS automatically create a layout.tsx(behind-the-scene) when you try to acess the 
root route
- and if you try to aceess a path/route that hasnt been created(folder/page.tx not exist inside app
dir, nextjs has you covered by automatically serving a notFound 404 page. no ned to create
a page for that. cool.
- eliminates the need to mess aroung installing/configuring routers in your code. nice
- files and folders does all the heaving lifting concerning routing.
- an exmaple of how nextjs favors conventions over configurations in routing and react generall

*- sooo, only a server-component can be served as a route? if you mark the page with
"client" it becomes a client component and will not be recognized as a route?




day5
- Nested routes
- create sub-folders with a page.tsx inside the route folders. pretty-straighforward and effi
cient
- nextjs basically mirros the folder structure to create/render a url.


day6
Dynamic routes
- predefined nested routes isnt always practical for complex apps/scenarios.
- dynamic routes offer more flexiblility 
- instaed of creating predefined nested routes for each elements(could be thousands which is
obviously not realistic or scalable), we use dynamic routes by creating a special subfolder
within the route folder but with square brackets, and then create a page.tsx route inside it
- nextJS treates folder names in square brackets[] as dynamic segments making a route
dynamic and flexible
- it gets cooler.
- every page defined in the app router recieves a route parameter through the 
parameters prop
- so params is an object that can be accessed/destructured in each page
- the type of the params is a promise that resolves into an objectt containing the dynamic 
segment as key value pairs
- with server-components, we can use async await to resolve the promise and access the
dynamic segment as key value pairs
- the dynamic routes approach is super-useful for building list-detail views in complex apps.eg
an eccormerce with millions of products with details, a blog with blogPosts/blogDetails
-url loooks like "http://localhost:3000/product/ferrari2025"

*- its a promise cos its not resolved yet? but when it resolves, we expect it to resolve
as an object of key-value pair?

code for day 6 or codeSharer
import React from 'react'

const ProductDetails = async ({ params, }: {
    params: Promise<{ productId: string }>
}) => {

    const prodId = (await params).productId;

    return (
        <div className='main flex h-100 justify-center align-center'>
            <h2 className='text-[1.5rem]'>Product details page, a dynamic subroute of product page</h2>
            <p className='text-[1.8rem]'>details about product: <span className='text-[purple]'>{prodId}</span></p>
        </div>
    )
}

export default ProductDetails



DAY7
-nested dynamic routes
- for handling multiple dynamic segments, alot of apps require it.
- you need a "/products/1/review/1" routes to render/display review 1/review 2 of each productItem.
- thats a multiple path segments. and we need to think in terms of nested folders
- we create a review folder inside the [productId],then a special square bracket folder as a 
dynamic route [reviewId], then a page.tsx within the sqaure bracket subroute.
- in review page, we extract productId and reviewId from params(both are promises that resolves 
into an object of keyvalue pairs)
-url looks like "http://localhost:3000/product/ferrari2025/review/20"
- we createvnested dynamic routes by using dynamic segments with nested folder names
- nextjs has another way to handle multiple dynamic path segments called the "catch all segments"
- each path after a slash/ is path segment. locahost:3000/product has one segment, /product/1, 2
segments, /product/3/review/2 thats 4 path segments.

-are pages generated from dynamic pages represented as sepreate/individual files for each path 
behind the scenes or is it really just that one single file and the info is just being fetch 
into it?


DAY8
CATCH ALL SEGMENTS(another powerful routing feature in NextJS
- say we have 20features with 20concepts = 400routes. nextjs uses a file-based routing system which
would mean 100seperate files in a project but with dynamic routing feature we can reduce that to
i file for feature, one file for concept nested within the doc folder but say we want more
segment paths? like a documentation sites where nesting goes deep. it could get ugly fast.
- enter 'catch all segment' feature
- its perfect for documentation sites where you want different url segments for organization and 
seos but keep the same basic layout
- 'catch all segment' feature shines when we want to reduce level of nesting in our routes folders.
 the deeper the nesting the more chaotic and tedius to maintain.
- since all pages in doc sites shares the same layout ,its smart to handle all route segments with
one file with the help of the 'catch all egment' feature.
- to set the 'catch-all-segment' feature up, we use a special nextjs naming convention where we 
use square brackets with three dots followed by url/route representaion name[...slug]. all 
route within this folder get caught by parent/main segment/route
- the 'catch-all-segments' features essentially captures all url segments and handles them in a 
single file
- perfect for when ou want different segments urls for organization and seo but keep the 
same basic layout
- we basically use the slug aaray of url strings to fetch the right docs to the screen by extracting
it from the params
- ther is also an 'optional-catch-all-segment'. you do this by wrapping the slug segment inside
an extra square brackets which makes a double square brackets [[...slugs]]








day 9
CREATING A CUSTOM 404 PAGE USING THE APP ROUTER
- by default, nextjs gives us a default 404 page when you visit an invalid url/route that does not
exist in the app folder
- the customizable 'not-found' page must be named 'not-found.js'/'not-found.tsx'. its a nexjs
naming convention thing
- not-found page can also be triggered programmaticaly/in your code using the 'not-found' function
provided by next/navigation

    if (parseInt(reviewId) > 1000) {
        notFound()
    }

- you can also create specific not-found page for different sections of your apps(cool)eg not-found
page for reviews when it exceed 1000 as we've programtically stated.
- nextjs uses the most specific not-found page it can find before defaulting to the global one
- the not-found component does not accept props though
- we can render dynamic content in the not-found page by extracting paths into the page with the
pathname hook from nextjs/navigation



day 10
 understanding file collocation in nextjs
- routes and other files can be collocated inside the app dir/folder
- point of this is, you can safely collocate files inside the app directory without them being
mistankenly treated as routes.
- for a file to be treated as a route, it must satisfy the route conditions(inside app dir,and must
be named as page.js/page.tsx
- its also possible to keep other non-route files outside the app directory. you could create a
new directory inside the src and keep them there. some prefer that approach



day10B
PRIVATE FOLDERS IN NEXTJS
- just another way to organize files in your nextjs projects
- like a way to tell nextjs "hey this folder is for internal logic/stuff, dont include it in
the routing system"
- the folders and subfolders are excluded from routing
- to create a private folder, just add _ before the file name and it automatically excludes any file
created within it from anything routing
- they are super useful for keeping your UI logic seperate from routing logic
- also easier to group related files in your code editor


day11
ROUTE GROUPS IN NEXTJS
- basically lets us organize routes and project files without disrupting the url structure in a 
nextjs app.
- to use route groups, you wrap the folder in a parentheses which basically tells nextjs to
ignore the folder as a route and treat it as a basic organizational tool
- they allow multiple route files to be organized together in our code editor without disrupting
urls definitions and structure
-super useful when working with a group cos of how it helps organize and label


INTERMISSION
-i've explored pages so far, which are route-specific UI components
- next, LAYOUTS IN NEXTJS



DAY12
 Layouts in nextjs(how they work, their importance
- a layout is a UI that is shared between multiple pages in your app
- we dont to create a layout from scratch, nextjs provides one by default. a layout.tsx file that
follow the special nextjs file naming conventions.
- the layout file in the app folder is called the root layout and is not optional. all nextjs app
must have one
- file so important, if you delete it, nextjs will automatically regenerate it lol
- layout renders the page.tsx as children prop.  page.tsx is nested inside the layout file
as a children prop which is a type of React.Node
- layout stays consistent, the page.tsx components which is a route gets repleced and rendered 
depending on the route we are on.
- it ensures a consistent structure across the entire app. actually very easy/convinient



- DAY 13
NESTED LAYOUT IN NEXTJS
- we can have a layout inside a layout in nextjs. useful for creating specific layouts for different
section of our page. eg special layout for productDetails section.
- all we need to do is add a layout.tsx(has to be layout.tsx, its a nextjs naming convention thing)
 file inside productDetails folder
- the layout.tsx is just another react components but will act as a layout specifically/only for the
 dynamic productDetails page.(how cool is this?)
- so, product page only has the root layout but product details page has not only the root layout 
but also a special layout just for it.
- the layout component acts as a children prop/page for the root layout and then the productDetails
page becomes a children for the custom layout page created for it.
- very powerful pattern and feature for creating custom and specialiized/nested layouts in nextjs 




day 14
- multiple root layouts in nextjs
- eg say we want a part of our app/page not not have any customization that comes with the layout
we defined.  
- this is only possible in nextjs using routeGroups and obviosly why they are so powerful in nextjs
- we just have to make sure no default layout.tsx file exist in app folder. we group files/routes
together using route groups and create a sepcialized layoutsvfor each groups. simple and intuitive
enough.
- route groups makes our code organzied/maintainable but also allow us to create customized UIs 
for different parts of our apps


-DIFFERENCE between path/segment/subroute? can they be used interchangeably?
www.localhost.com/about. is /about a subroute or a path or a segment ?

day15
 ROUTING METADATA IN NEXTJS
- the metadata api in nextjs. a powerful featur that lets us define metadata for each page in nextjs
which helps with SEO
- defininf metadata ensures our content looks great when its shared or indexed by search engines
helping with SEO
- with the app router in nextjs, we have 2 ways to handle metadatas in layout.tsx or page.tsx files
1. we cann export a static metadata object
2. export a dynamic generateMetaData function

- some rules about configuring metadata
1. both layout.tsx and page.tsx files/pages can export metadata
2 layout metadata applies to all pages while page.tsx metadata is specific only to that page
3. metadata follow a top-down order, starting from root-level
4. when metadata exists in multiple places along a route, they merge together, with page metadata
overiding layout metadata for the case of any matching properties. deeper path segments take priority

-for static metadata configuration, we create and export a metadata object. mostly straightforward.

-CONFIGURING DYNAMIC METADATA could get a little tricky
- its useful for when metadatas depends on dynamically generated content eg current route parameters
or some info from an api or even metadata defined in parent segments/path/route
- we setup dynamic metadata by defining and exporting a generateMetadata function 
in page.tsx or layout.tsx file eg productDetails file/page where all productID are generated/extracted
from the route params

- something to note is that you cant both metadata object and the generateMetaData function in the same
route segment/page. its one or the other

- a crucial limitation with working with metadata in nextjs is that it doesnt work in client components
- a workaround would be to create a server-component and import the client component into the server
and export metadata from there. its a recommended way to handle metadata in client components


DAY16
- TITLE METADATA IN NEXTJS
- its main use is to define document title
- could be string or object
- nextjs gives us option to define the title metadata as objects for better/more control. 
3 powerful options

1. setting default fallback value incase the metadata/title of a page isnt set
2. using the template option/field to add consistent/fixed prefixes/suffixes to page title(applies to
child routes). useful when you want consistent title formatting accross your page assuming its a
multi-page app.
3. using the abolute property in a child route to override any template set in the layout or by the 
parent route/segment


DAY17
LINK COMPONENT IN NEXTJS
- navigating through page with the link component
- dynamic routing within our nextjs app
- 'replace' property when placed on a link element as an attribute, replaces current history.skips it.
takes you back to prev before current prev.



DAY18
ACTIVE LINKS IN NEXTJS
- sstyling active links
- nextJs gives us a usePathName hook to extract the current path and we can use it to programmtically
add dynamic styling to a link element
